# Ai_Assistant

This is an straight forward Assistant which I am creating to teach myself about API's
Currently trying to come up with simple ideas for what the assistant can search for, e.g. Weather in a given City

All packages needed are stored in 'Install.txt' file and all the resources I am referencing is under 'References.txt'

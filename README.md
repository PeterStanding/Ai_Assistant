# Ai_Assistant

This is an straight forward Assistant which I am creating to teach myself about API's
Currently trying to come up with simple ideas for what the assistant can search for, e.g. Weather in a given City

All packages needed are stored in 'Install.txt' file and all the resources I am referencing is under 'References.txt'

Required to run the code is Ollama Gemma3, This is act as the bulk part of the AI. My aim is to connect the GUI to Ollama and will allow the user to look up information based on the local computer
